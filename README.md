EcoTrack is an open-source environmental monitoring platform that helps communities track, analyze, and respond to local ecological changes. By combining IoT sensor networks with citizen science initiatives, EcoTrack empowers people to become stewards of their local environments.

## 🚀 Features

- **Distributed Sensor Network**: Deploy low-cost, energy-efficient sensors to monitor air quality, water conditions, soil health, and biodiversity indicators
- **Real-time Data Dashboard**: Access environmental metrics through an intuitive web and mobile interface
- **Community Engagement Tools**: Report observations, organize cleanup events, and collaborate on conservation projects
- **Data Analysis Suite**: Visualize trends, receive alerts, and generate reports on environmental conditions
- **Open API**: Integrate with other systems or build custom applications using our comprehensive API

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 16+
- PostgreSQL 13+
- Raspberry Pi (for sensor deployments) or compatible microcontrollers
